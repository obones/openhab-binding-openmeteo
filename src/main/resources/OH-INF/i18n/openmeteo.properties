runtime.no-bridge = So far no bridge is defined. Please add a thing of type "Open Meteo" to establish a connection to the service, which provides the prerequisite for further commissioning.
runtime.one-bridge = A bridge element is already defined. Thus, you can now set up additional devices by means of search (or discovery) or by adding things manually.
runtime.multiple-bridges = There are more than one bridges defined. This is of course possible with several different Open Meteo services. Every other case should be avoided.
